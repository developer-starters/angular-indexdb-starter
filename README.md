# Angular Indexdb Starter Kit

### Tools Supported

- [Angular](https://angular.dev/)
- [PNPM](https://pnpm.io/)
- [indexDB](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/storage/indexeddb)
- [Idb](https://www.npmjs.com/package/idb) to interact with IndexDB in Browser.

### Purpose Solved

- Angular App needed for Offline Support
- Angular App that utilizes the indexDB Browser DB API to persist data in browser instead of localStorag/SessionStorage

### Usecases where it can be used
- Requirement is to store data within browser for offline sync
- Progressive Web Apps

### Restrictions
- Works only with Browsers having support for IndexDB API

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
